# CairoSpots
This is my 5th project "Tour Guide App" in the Google | Udacity 2017/2018 Scholarship program,

I spent a very happy time dealing with CollapsingLayout & CoordinatorLayout, But I faced an issue to auto hide both the top toolbar & tabLayout while scrolling ( to give more viewable space in landscape mode too ), But with the Udacity's reviewer suggestions & My classroom mentor I did it!



I build this project to meet these rubrics:

# Layout
## Overall Layout
App contains at least 4 lists of relevant attractions for a location

## Navigation
User navigates between lists in Fragments using either a Navigation Drawer or a ViewPager plus TabLayout.

## List Item Contents
Each list item contains information about an event, restaurant, historical site, or similar.

## Pictures
At least one list includes pictures of the location.
### I used Glide library to retrive images sample in each list for each spot 

## Layout Best Practices
The code adheres to all of the following best practices:
Text sizes are defined in sp
Lengths are defined in dp
Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.


# Functionality

## Location Object
App contains a custom object for storing location information .

## Custom Adapter
App uses a custom adapter to populate the layout with views based on instances of the custom class.

## String Storage
All strings are stored in the strings.xml resource file.

## Image Storage
All images are stored as drawables.
All drawables are stored at multiple densities.

## Errors
The code runs without errors.

# Code Readability

## Readability
Code is easily readable so that a fellow programmer can understand the purpose of the app.

## Naming Conventions
All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named so that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.

## Formatting
The code is properly formatted:
No unnecessary blank lines
No unused variables or methods
No commented out code
The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.
